        <h1>Protect Your Organization Against QR Code Phishing</h1>

        <div class="summary">
            <p>With the rise in the use of QR codes for business transactions and other purposes, QR code phishing is becoming a significant threat. Cybercriminals can embed malicious links within QR codes, making it difficult for individuals and businesses to detect threats. Microsoft Defender for Office now offers an advanced QR code scanning feature to help protect organizations from these attacks.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What is QR Code Phishing?</h2>
        <p>QR code phishing involves attackers generating QR codes that contain malicious links. When scanned, users can unknowingly visit malicious websites or expose sensitive information. Since QR codes don't reveal the underlying URL until scanned, it’s a stealthy method of phishing.</p>

            <li>Integration with existing Microsoft Defender threat protection tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How it Benefits Your Organization</h2>
        <p>This feature enhances your organization’s protection by preventing phishing attempts through QR codes. It adds another layer of defense against malicious actors who may exploit QR codes for cyber attacks, keeping your employees safe from harmful websites and malicious downloads.</p>
