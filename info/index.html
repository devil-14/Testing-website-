						<p><font size="3"><em>QR code phishing campaigns have most recently become the fastest growing type of email-based attack. These types of attacks are growing and embed QR code images linked to malicious content directly into the email body, to evade detection. They often entice unwitting users with seemingly genuine prompts, like a password reset or a two-factor authentication request. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Defender for Office 365</a> is continuously adapting as threat actors evolve their methodologies. In this blog post we’ll share more details on how we’re helping defenders address this threat and keeping end-users safe.<br></em></font><strong><font size="5"><br>What is a QR Code?</font></strong></p>
<p>A QR code (short for "Quick Response code") is a two-dimensional barcode that can be scanned using a smartphone or other mobile device equipped with a camera. QR codes can contain various types of information, such as website URLs, contact information, product details, and more. They are most commonly used for taking users to websites, files, or applications. The easiest way to think about a QR code is to treat it just as you would a URL.</p>

<p>For example, when this QR code is scanned it will redirect you to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Defender for Office 365 product page</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">QR Code Phishing on the Rise</font></strong></p>
<p>Over the last few years QR Codes have seen a rise in popularity in legitimate use scenarios, in part due to COVID. You have probably seen them in restaurants, parking lots, and marketing. In 2022, The Federal Bureau of Investigation raised awareness about <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220118" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">cybercriminals tampering with QR codes to steal financial funds</a> from victims. And while until very recently QR Code phishing attacks were relatively rare, around mid-September 2023, Microsoft Security Research &amp; Threat Intelligence observed a significant increase in phishing attempts related to QR-codes. Our telemetry showed a 23% increase in attacks using this exploit within one week alone.<br><br><strong>So why use QR codes for phishing?</strong><br>QR Codes present a unique challenge for security providers as they appear as an image during mail flow and are unreadable until rendered. Once the QR Code is rendered (what the human eye sees) it can then be scanned/processed for further analysis.</p>
<p>QR codes are used in phishing attacks for mainly two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>They move the attack away from well-protected corporate environments and onto the victim’s personally owned mobile device<span>,</span> which may be less secure.</li>
<li>They leverage the most common credential theft vector which is the uniform resource locator (URL).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A QR code can be easily manipulated to redirect unsuspecting victims to malicious websites or to download malware in exactly the same way as URLs, only by putting the URL in a more difficult-to-detect location. Adversaries craft QR codes to look legitimate, for example a message coming from an IT Administrator, and when scanned will ask the user to verify their account via their credentials or download a malicious file onto the user's device. This is becoming more common as the constrained screen size of mobile devices can make warning signs of phishing attacks difficult for users to recognize.</p>
<p>The multiple layers of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) reveal various patterns of QR Code Phishing messages seen by Defender for Office 365. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">URL redirection</a></li>
<li>Minimal to no text (reducing signals for ML detection)</li>
<li>Abuse of known brands</li>
<li>Abuse of sending infrastructure known for sending legitimate emails</li>
<li>A variety of social lures including 2 factor auth, document signing, and more</li>
<li>Embedding QR codes in attachments</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few examples below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>QR Codes are embedded as inline images within email body</strong><br>In the example below, the QR code is embedded inline within the body of the email, which when scanned redirects the user to a phishing website attempting to gather their credentials.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">How Defender for Office 365 detects QR Code phishing</font></strong></p>
<p>Given these attack techniques, it is clear that QR code phishing is functionally identical to credential harvesting. Let’s take a closer look at how Defender for Office 365 protects against them. The below detection capabilities are available in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/eop-about?view=o365-worldwide" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exchange Online Protection</a> &amp; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-security-comparison?view=o365-worldwide#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Defender for Office 365</a> licenses. Based on the specific license, the checks will vary as mentioned below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Image Detection</strong></p>
<p>With advanced image extraction technologies, Defender for Office 365 and Exchange Online Protection detects a QR Code in a message inline during mail flow. The system extracts URL metadata from a QR Code and feeds that signal into our existing threat protection and filtering capabilities for URLs. By using these signals, the underlying URL can also be sent to a sandbox environment for detonation and the malicious threats are proactively identified and blocked before they reach a user’s mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Threat Signals</strong></p>
<p>Defender for Office 365 and Exchange Online Protection uses a variety of mail flow signals to determine and act on a message. Essentially, no single input determines the final classification of an email. It is always a composite of several signals to construct a robust context. The QR Code signal is used in combination with sender intelligence, message headers, recipient details, content filtering, and the relationships shared between them are fed into machine learning algorithms to produce the highest quality verdict as the context permits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>URL Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The URLs extracted from QR Codes are analyzed by machine learning models, checked against both internal and external sources of reputation and for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mdo-security-comparison?view=o365-worldwide#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 / Plan 2</a> licenses are sandboxed for further investigation as needed to assess the risk for detonation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Heuristics-based Rules</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft also deploys heuristic rules within Defender for Office 365 and Exchange Online Protection to reason over and block malicious messages. This capability constitutes one of our most flexible and fastest moving mitigations, and it is used extensively to mitigate attack patterns as they morph day to day during major campaigns such as the QR Code phishing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font size="5">Microsoft Defender for Office 365 blocks QR Code Phishing at Scale</font></strong></p>
<p>Here are a few datapoints that help put this strategy into perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the power of <span>existing capabilities </span>and robust tools we have built, many heuristics-based rules were released within minutes leading to ~1.5 million QR code phishing blocked in email body per day in the last several months! As the attack patterns evolve, new rules continue to get released and refined as needed.</li>
<li>The advanced detection technologies built to extract QR code related metadata (URL and text), have scanned more than 200 million unique URLs on average weekly, out of which more than 100 million came from QR codes.</li>
<li>Our advanced detection technologies have blocked more than 18 million unique phishing emails containing a QR code image in the email body on average weekly and around 3 million unique QR code phishing emails per day.</li>
<li>QR code phishing protection includes Commercial as well as Consumer emails. More than 96% of these are QR code phishing blocked by our technologies in Enterprise alone.</li>
</ul>
